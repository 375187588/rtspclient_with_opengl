// Define a data sink (a subclass of "MediaSink") to receive the data for each subsession (i.e., each audio or video 'substream').
// In practice, this might be a class (or a chain of classes) that decodes and then renders the incoming audio or video.
// Or it might be a "FileSink", for outputting the received data into a file (as is done by the "openRTSP" application).
// In this example code, however, we define a simple 'dummy' sink that receives incoming data, but does nothing with it.

public:
	static DummySink* createNew(UsageEnvironment& env,
			MediaSubsession& subsession, // identifies the kind of data that's being received
			char const* streamId = NULL); // identifies the stream itself (optional)
